1. About the Organization
Mission or Purpose:
The Association des Ivoiriens au Texas (AIT) is all about bringing Ivorians in Texas together as one big family. Our goal is to stay connected, support each other, and celebrate our beautiful Ivorian culture while building a strong community here in the U.S. We help new arrivals settle in, promote education, and make sure our culture shines wherever we go.
Community Description:
AIT is a lively mix of Ivorians from all over Texas — students, families, professionals — everyone! We share good vibes, help one another when needed, and create spaces where people feel at home. Whether it’s a party, a community event, or just a moment to talk about home, AIT is where Ivorians come together.
Tagline or Slogan:
🇨🇮 “Together we rise — Unity, Culture, and Progress.”
3. Website Goals
The AIT website will be our community hub — a place to:
✅ Share what’s happening in the Ivorian community across Texas
✅ Post and promote events
✅ Highlight members and community news
✅ Welcome new members
✅ Collect donations and support for our projects
✅ Show off photos and videos from our amazing gatherings
Other goal:
To keep Ivorians everywhere connected and proud of our roots while building bridges with other African communities in Texas.
5. Content
Existing Text/Content:
We already have our mission and values written out, but we’ll also add fun, personal stuff — stories from members, event recaps, shoutouts to volunteers, and maybe even a “Spotlight of the Month.”
Photos/Videos:
Yes! We have tons — from cookouts, Independence Day parties, gala nights, to community meetings. The gallery will definitely show the heart of AIT.
6. Branding & Design
Colors:
Let’s stick with our flag colors — orange, white, and green — they represent our pride, peace, and unity. We can mix in gold or brown tones for warmth and that classy Ivorian touch.
Design Style:
We want something modern but still full of life — clean layout, bold colors, and lots of pictures of our people and culture. Something that feels homey, positive, and easy to navigate.
Websites We Like:
Sites like Nigerians in Diaspora USA or Cameroonians in Houston — community-based and simple but full of energy.
